# River-Habitat-Classification
# River Habitat Segmentation and Debris Detection Pipeline

An end-to-end deep learning pipeline for habitat segmentation and debris detection from UAV-captured orthomosaics. Combines semantic segmentation (FCN), domain-adjusted postprocessing, SAM refinement, and object detection.

## üöÄ Key Features

- DeepLab-based habitat segmentation
- Domain knowledge‚Äìenforced spatial postprocessing
- Integration with [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)
- Detectron2-based debris detection
- Scalable to large orthomosaics (split-merge utilities)
